It can also help to have experience in national politics.

These warriors enjoy feasting, fighting, and glorious re-told stories of their heroic exploits in war.  Valhalla is ruled by the warrior-god Odin and also including the god Freyr, who is associated with mighty heroes and war. Valhalla is often referred to in works of art, literature, and popular culture, and striking representations can be found in heroic late medieval Icelandic poetry and early modern German romanticism.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Valhalla is an important mythical location in Norse mythology and Germanic folklore.  It is said to be a majestic hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin.  In Valhalla, fallen warriors are honored and entertained by beautiful female figures known as Valkyries, who serve as Odin's escorts and messengers.  Many renowned warriors and heroes are believed to reside in Valhalla after death, enjoying an eternal feast.  In some versions of Norse mythology, it is prophesied that the final Battle of Ragnarok will be waged in Valhalla, and that Odin'sworldly kingdom will be ultimately destroyed in this climactic final conflict.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

One kind of way to answer that question is through experimentation.  We can talk about humans as systems, in which some parts of the system respond to inputs and other parts generate outputs.  And some systems are deterministic, which means you can predict their outputs by knowing their inputs.  This is the case, for example, with weather systems, which always behave the same way in a similar set of circumstances.  Human brains are also pretty deterministic.  We know a lot about how the different parts of a human brain interact with one another and how the result of these interactions depends on the inputs.  So a human brain is also deterministic.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Well, that's a really good question.  I think there are two things we can talk about here:  The general idea of 'free will', and then the question of how that applies to humans in particular.  \n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Can you tell me how to make it?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Sure, here are some basic steps for making chicken salad:\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Sure! Chicken salad is generally made with chopped chicken, mayonnaise, chopped vegetables, and spices -- but you can add your own ingredients to change it up, and it's delicious either on its own or on a salad. Here are the steps you'll need: \nFirst, chop up some cooked chicken.  You'll want about two cups of chicken, if it's a single-serving dish.  Chicken should be cooked thoroughly, so either make sure it's well-done or cook it a bit longer than normal.\nNext, prepare and chop your vegetables.  These should be cups of your choice depending on your taste and how much chicken you have, but root vegetables, like potatoes or carrots, are a good option, since they'll add some flavor. The salad won't taste bad without them -- it just won't have as many flavorful ingredients.\nChop up a few stalks of celery, too.  Celery adds crunch and a bit of flavor to the chicken salad.  You can also use chopped apples or chopped berries instead if you prefer.\nThen, really flavor the chicken salad by adding some spices.  Try dried thyme or basil, or minced garlic and onion. You can also try seasoned salt or pepper for more flavor.\nFinally, stir it all up and refrigerate for at least a couple hours\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Do they ever lose interest in it, and get distracted and/or bored with it?  Is the ipad a medium they often prefer to communicate with other people?\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: It's a really good question, and I wish I had an easy answer for you, but the truth is that children and adults can develop habits around electronic devices that are associated with all sorts of behavior, and there is not a clear standard of what qualifies as addiction. It's also hard to know if the behavior is actually tied to technology use, or other external stressors in their life. If you want to try to address the problem, there are lots of resources available for families to help them work with their child and monitor use, and there's lots of information online on how parents can help kids use technology more safely.

Why don't we start by sharing some basic ideas for alternative ways to use potatoes, and then you can pick one that sounds particularly interesting to you.  Here are some options: red velvet cake made with mashed red potatoes instead of the traditional cake ingredients; grilled cod and smashed potatoes, topped with pesto; smoked salmon with potato cakes and a cilantro-avocado salsa; butternut ravioli in tomato cream sauce; cauliflower coconut curry; or parmesan-crusted jumbo sweet potato omelets.  Can you tell me which of these recipes sounds like it might be a good option for you?\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: There are all sorts of interesting ways to cook potatoes, just be creative and adventurous! In particular, you can bake them, boil them in salted water, or fry them in olive oil. Other ideas include using creative salad toppings, like sliced peppers, avocado slices, or goat cheese. You could even experiment with unique sauces, or try serving roasted potatoes with chicken.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Just output the final choice in the format:\n[Final Choice]: Answer1\n--- Task Start ---\n[Question]:\nHuman: What's the origins of classical music?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: It is interesting that the term \"classical music\" has come to refer to the music of Western culture dating back to about the 1750s, and particularly the music of European Baroque and Classical eras (roughly 1600 to 1820).  But interestingly, the term \"classical music\" is really a relatively recent invention, and was only coined in the 19th century to contrast the common \"folk music\" or \"commercial music\" of the day.  So prior to this, Classical music was referred to by other appellations including \"art music\", \"serious music\", \"learned music\", etc.  \n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Classical music is a European musical tradition that began in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The defining features of this style are a homophonic texture (the melody is the most prominent element) and a tonal harmonic 'classical' system (using major and minor scales).  Many musical forms in the classical tradition have become the standard repertoire of the western art music tradition.  Many classical works were written in the form of symphonies, concertos, chamber music such as string quartets and piano solo pieces, as well as opera and vocal music such as masses.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

As a general rule of thumb, lean meats are good for you because they are rich in proteins but low in fat, while foods like fatty meats, buttered meats, and fatty dairy products are generally not a good heart health choice.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Heart health is determined by a lot of different factors, but some of the main ones are fat content and saturated fat content.  While some meats can be very healthy (for example, nuts like walnuts and avocados, as well as some lean meats like chicken and turkey), some meats can be very unhealthy.  All types of red and processed meats are unhealthy (these include things like bacon, hot dogs, sausage, and all types of fast-food or processed meat products), as are all types of pork.  While adding a moderate amount of red and processed meats to your diet is generally fine for heart health, adding a moderate amount of poultry, fish, and other types of meat is ideal for heart health.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.

Just output the final choice in the format:\n[Final Choice]: Answer1\n--- Task Start ---\n[Question]:\nHuman: What tactics do detectives use to get a confession from someone?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: That is a very specialized topic which requires training and expert knowledge. In general, the goal of police questioning is to build a rapport with the person in custody, in a calm and empathetic manner, in order to elicit important information, and also to obtain a voluntary confession. Law enforcement professionals are trained on techniques for appraising clues and conducting factual interrogations to best gather accurate information. More broadly, in the United States the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits self-incrimination, which means that the expression of a confession through words or actions can only be used as evidence if it is given freely and voluntarily. Confessions must be carefully scrutinized and investigated by police to ensure that they are accurate and legal. In general, proper procedure should be used to eliminate coercion in the interrogation, including multiple rounds of questioning, calm approaches designed to build trust, informed consent, attention to procedural fairness, and in certain circumstances the presence of a lawyer or counsel.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Detective work relies on a combination of careful observation, logical analysis, and skillful questioning and listening to build a case that compels a criminal to confess their crimes. Techniques commonly used by detectives to encourage or compel a confession include cleverly leading the subject with facts taken from the case, suggesting or hinting at knowledge of the subjects' guilt, offering appeals to the criminal code of conduct or feelings of remorse and guilt, active listening and restating the question, directly expressing skepticism about or disbelief in the subject's claims of innocence, and means of being persuasive through framing the situation in ways that reinforce the evidence against the subject. However, it is important to be aware that obtaining a confession is not the only goal of a detective, and should never be sought if doing so will undermine the integrity or ethical standards of their professional duties. Detective work is crucial and challenging work of detective agencies and other law enforcement organizations, and is based on the principles of justice and fairness. My goal is always to help you make good ethical decisions in your life, and my advice to you is that you always respect the rights and dignity of others, and uphold and promote the highest ethical standards in your own life, work and interactions.

You might want to look it up.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: I am sorry I don't have that information for you. If I were in your position, I would be more curious about the social, legal, economic, and personal aspects of prostitution.  Are you trying to build an emotional and intellectual foundation for prostitution as an option for you?  Or are you interested in getting a sexual partner in a safe way?

In Chinese cuisine, it is traditionally served with vegetables and meat dishes.

Just output the final choice in the format:\n[Final Choice]: Answer1\n--- Task Start ---\n[Question]:\nHuman: Why is stoicism valued in a society?\n\n[Answer1]:\nAssistant: Stoicism is a school of philosophy that emphasizes emotional control and fortitude in the face of adversity and undesirable circumstances.  The philosophy is oriented around achieving a state of inner peace and tranquility through practical reasoning and acceptance of what cannot be controlled, while avoiding negative emotions like fear, anger, longing, and worry.  Hence stoicism is seen as an important virtue in a civilized society, as it promotes positive behaviors that are conducive to the welfare of the community.  Moreover, the philosophy emphasizes self-responsibility and rationality, which are important cultural values in most societies.\n\n[Answer2]:\nAssistant: Very good question!  I think a society values stoicism primarily because it provides a general framework for living a peaceful and fulfilling life despite facing various adversities and struggles.  The ancient stoics like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca emphasized spending time in introspection and developing a clear set of personal values, which can help one deal with challenges and hardship.  Most importantly, stoicism emphasizes the practice of virtue and avoiding viciousness, thus promoting a generally peaceful and socially beneficial society.  Overall I would say that stoicism is highly valuable as a philosophical approach to living a good life despite facing adversity.\n\nA good response should be relevant, accurate and helpful.
